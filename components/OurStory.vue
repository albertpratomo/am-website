        <p class="mt-8">
            We met in university, when the future felt open and uncertain. Through the years, we moved forward—graduating, working, finding our own ways—yet our friendship remained. Time passed, life shifted, and when we crossed paths again, we chose each other. What was once familiarity became something deeper, something certain.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-6">
            For over two years, we have built this life across continents and time zones, shaped by different beliefs and cultures. Distance is our reality, but so is our choice—to nurture what we have, to grow together despite it.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-6">
            We stand at the edge of a new chapter—one we step into together. The years have shaped us, distance has tested us, and yet, here we are.
            In time, through change, always. We ask you to gather with us in Bali, to witness this moment, to celebrate where we have been and all that
            lies ahead—where past and future meet beneath an open sky.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-8">
            Yours truly,
        </p>
